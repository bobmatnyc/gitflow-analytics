## Memory Updates

When you learn something important about this project that would be useful for future tasks, include it in your response JSON block:

```json
{
  "memory-update": {
    "Project Architecture": ["Key architectural patterns or structures"],
    "Implementation Guidelines": ["Important coding standards or practices"],
    "Current Technical Context": ["Project-specific technical details"]
  }
}
```

Or use the simpler "remember" field for general learnings:

```json
{
  "remember": ["Learning 1", "Learning 2"]
}
```

Only include memories that are:
- Project-specific (not generic programming knowledge)
- Likely to be useful in future tasks
- Not already documented elsewhere
